                    Collaborated with a team to build a book review website for user-generated content. Guests can 
                    search for books or users, and read book reviews or look at users' profiles. Logged-in users can
                    leave reviews and write comments. They can also get book suggestions based on their reviewed books.

                    Our tech stack includes Flask (Python), PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Jinja2, and PureCSS. We incorporated
                    a few APIs to enhance user experience, such as the Google Books API, the OpenAI (ChatGPT) API, and the
                    Gravatar API for user profiles. My work focused on building the user profile experience, including the
                    backend services, front-end interface, and database interactions.

                    Simple survey website. Users can opt to take the survey or not. 
                    Used Flask  for the backend, and PureCSS, jinja2, and Chart.js for the front end. 
                    Data is stored on Postgres on the hosted website. If you would like to see  
                    infographics about user answers, go to this webpage on the site (if you know how 
                    to do this): /admin/summary.

                    This website will take <span class="needs-work">more than a few seconds to load</span> because of 
                    the hosting service and free tier plan it is on. Planning to move it soon. Might help to refresh the
                    page after 10 - 20 seconds.

                    A website  for an imaginary small business. Customers can order a phone and see user reviews. 
                    An administrative page allows the owners to look at customer orders, complete the orders, and 
                    start/end a sale.
