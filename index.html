                I am Andrei, a senior studying computer science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. 
                My current focus is gaining more experience with software engineering, and full stack web development. 
                I am looking for opportunities to practice my skills, work with a team, and to continue learning. 
                Below are some of my projects. Please have a look at them and provide feedback.
