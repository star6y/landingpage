                I am Andrei, currently a senior pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of 
                Minnesota - Twin Cities. My strong enthusiasm for technology and passion for learning has 
                sparked my interest in software engineering and full-stack development, with a focus on the 
                backend. I am seeking opportunities to practice my skills, expand my knowledge, and work with amazing teams.
