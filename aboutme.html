    <h1 class="linked content">About Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p> My current focus is to gain more experience in software engineering. Utilizing both the 
            Waterfall and Agile methodologies in school and personal projects with friends has deepened
            my appreciation for the software engineering process. 
            
            I have come to appreciate the effort required in the project specification and design phase. 
            These experiences have given me a better understanding of software mechanics, and it has helped me
            produce cleaner and more readable code. 
            Despite this progress, there is still much to learn. 
            I am eager to acquire more hands-on experience by collaborating on larger-scale projects with a team.
            <br><br>
            Recently, I enrolled in an Internet programming class that taught me how to construct a website 
            from scratch. 
            The course was so engaging that I decided to become a teaching assistant to help students discover their 
            passion for full stack development.
            My interest primarily lies in backend development, where I enjoy designing and building servers and databases.
