    <h1 class="linked content">About Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My current focus is on gaining more experience in software engineering. Utilizing both the 
            Waterfall and Agile methodologies in school and personal projects with friends and classmates 
            has deepened my appreciation for the software engineering process. I have come to value the 
            effort required in the project specification and design phases, leading to cleaner code and a 
            better understanding of software mechanics. Despite this progress, there is still much to learn. 
            I am eager to acquire more hands-on experience by collaborating on larger-scale projects with a team.

            Recently, I enrolled in an Internet programming class that taught me how to construct a website 
            from scratch. The course was so engaging that I opted to switch my teaching assistant assignment 
            the following semester, enabling me to assist other students in learning website development. My 
            interest primarily lies in backend development, where I enjoy designing and building servers and databases.
